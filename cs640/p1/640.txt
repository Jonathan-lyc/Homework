Traceroute now has 4 entries instead of 2. It used to go through network 6 to the host. Now it goes through 5, 2, and then 6. It is routing around the failed link.

Log 2.7
The TTL changed back to 63 from 61, takes less time, and didn't miss a sequence when the link came back up.

Log 2.8
The path is exactly the same as it was before the link went down.

Log 2.9
The metric has returned to 2, from 5 whilst the link was down.
