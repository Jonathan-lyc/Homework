fcntl.h - Added O_EXTENT
stat.h - Added file type T_EXTENT

To check/change - 
Everytime someone touches addrs[]
read() write() open() 
sysfile.c create()

For addrs: 32bit array, first 3 bytes for pointer, last byte for size. use shifts to make this work.
Look for every instance where addrs[] is used, update if necessary. At least wrap in an if(ip->type != EXTENT){}

Modify stat() syscall to return block address of file also.
